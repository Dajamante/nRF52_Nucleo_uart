# Uart nRF52/STM32F401

The template of this project is done with: 

Based on https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template

This repository is a collection of "pair" code between nRF52 (the sender) and STM32F401-Nucleo (the receiver).

* Nucleo D8/PA9 (tx) - nRF52 p1.07 (rx)
* Nucleo D2/PA10 (rx)- nRF52 p1.08 (tx)
* GND - GND

# How to run code

Open one terminal window *per* microcontroller and run:

```
cargo rb <project name>
```

Some programs are interracting, with the nRF52 as the sender and the Nucleo as the receiver.


|     | Interracting? | nRF52/Nucleo code   | What does it do?                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 6   | yes        | `postcard.rs`       | nRF52 is blinking the led of the nucleo üí°, with a [cobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing) command. Using [Postcard](https://docs.rs/postcard/0.7.3/postcard/)! |
| 7   | yes        | `pws.rs`            | nRF52 is dimming(*) the light of the nucleo üîÖüí°üîÖ                                                                                                                                              |
| 8   | yes        | `interval.rs`       | nRF52 is blinking the light of the nucleo, with intervals. The light can be dimmed üîÖüí°üîÖ.                                                                                                      |

*ATM the dimmer function is very bad, and need to be fixed (the incrementation must be based on a function, not magic numbers).

There is also an `interrupt.rs` file in the `Nucleo401` folder but I forgot what it was about ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. I did need an interrupt at some point.
